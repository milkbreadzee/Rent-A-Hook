Problem Statement/Background

Small Scale Fisheries are important contributors to local, national and international markets.

Small-scale fishermen often face a range of problems related to their lack of access to proper equipment. Some of the key issues they may encounter include:

Inefficient fishing: Without access to modern fishing equipment, small-scale fishermen may be unable to catch as many fish as they could with more advanced gear. This can make their operations less efficient and less profitable.

Safety risks: Lack of access to proper equipment can also pose safety risks for small-scale fishermen. For example, outdated or poorly maintained boats may be more prone to accidents or capsizing.

Increased labor: Without access to modern fishing equipment, small-scale fishermen may have to rely on more labor-intensive methods, which can be physically demanding and time-consuming.

Limited expansion: Without access to the latest fishing equipment, small-scale fishermen may be unable to expand their operations or take advantage of new opportunities.

Competition: Small-scale fishermen who do not have access to modern equipment may struggle to compete with larger-scale operations that do have access to such equipment.

Overall, the lack of access to proper equipment can significantly impact the efficiency, safety, and profitability of small-scale fishing operations. Ensuring that small-scale fishermen have access to the equipment they need can help to improve their operations and support their livelihoods.


Our Solution

Our idea is a website that creates a platform for small-scale fishermen, who don't have access to modern, more efficient, and safe methods of fishing, to rent such equipment for their fishing endeavors.

Equipment such as :	
Well maintained boats
Snap Proof Fish lines
Fishing Nets
Modern Fishing Rods, etc

It also includes the payment integration for the seamless transactions required to make the whole process more convenient for both ends.

As an expansion, we are also planning on targetting tourist areas as a user base.


Working

The main UI is focused on the user, who is renting out the equipments.

Features provided are:
Search and Filter feature.
Delivery and PickUp services of equipments.
Payment Integration.
Dashboard to see currently rented equipments.



Stacks
REACT - FrontEnd
NodeJs - BackEnd
DataBase - MYSQL


Revenue Model and Future Expansions

Rent/Lease Revenue Model:

The income received by the business will be based on the rent of the equipments provided.

Since fishing has  a seasonal market, we offer renting in two different rates:
Daily Rate 
Monthly Rate



Future Expansions: 

Integrating an information portal for users to share current conditions of local water bodies.
Providing articles on newer, safer fishing practices that may not have reached the local community.
Providing repair services for fishing equipments in places where it may not be available locally.
Platform fishing products of other companies 








MARKET RESEARCH



The SSF communities of Kerala State form the backbone of the fisheries sector. The active fishers today number about 150,000. Over the last 40 years the SSF sector has undergone a great metamorphosis on all fronts â€“ socio-economic, technological and political. 

The attention on the mechanised sector of fishing which started in 1960s was stopped and the focus was turned to the small-scale fishery from the 1990s onwards. In the last three decades, the fishery sector production and its contribution to NSDP has been declining at the macro level. In the case of fishery resource too, there is decline in stock and variety, most of which has hurt the small scale and traditional fishery. 5. At micro level too, there is evidence of increasing poverty and indebtedness among the fisherfolk across the selected districts. The poor socio-economic situation of the fisherfolk is closely related to their increased due to the family formation and the initial lack of land ownership, the situation of very congested housing still prevails as a serious challenge among the small-scale and traditional fisherfolk.

1)Peak fishing season in kerala is march to may -3 months
Average cost of fishing rod of good quality(telescopic rods) is 1300 to 2000 rupees
(source- https://www.amazon.in/Telescopic-Fishing-Lures-Accessories-Complete/dp/B09XM52CBZ)

We try to make back about 1700 rupees in a span of about 4 months
Assume average of 5 days of usage per week(because of weekend holidays)
80 days to make back 1700 rupees
20 rupees per day 
Only has to be serviced once a year so not much servicing cost


2)Fishing reels cost an average of 1500 rupees

Because of the huge price of the fishing boat we will not be stocking on it at the start of the business but we will add it as a future expansion when we start to turn a net profit 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
